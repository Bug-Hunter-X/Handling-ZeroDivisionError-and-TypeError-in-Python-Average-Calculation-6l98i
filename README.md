This repository contains examples of common Python errors and their solutions. Specifically, it demonstrates how to handle ZeroDivisionError (division by zero) and TypeError (unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str') that can occur when calculating the average of a list of numbers.

The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version.
